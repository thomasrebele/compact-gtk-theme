=== CompactTheme ===

Overly space consuming buttons, tabs, and other widgets annoy me, as I don't have much space to waste on my 13" laptop.
So I tried to adapt existing themes. I could achieve this easily for gtk2, but it screwed up gtk3 applications.
Recently I found the mate themes, giving a mix which might not look very consistent, but at least decent enough for me.

This theme uses
- Industrial theme from the Debian gtk2-engines package (which uses http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-engines/)
- TraditionalOk from https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-themes

Use at your own risk!

=== Dependencies ===

Requires the gtk2-engines package

    apt install gtk2-engines
